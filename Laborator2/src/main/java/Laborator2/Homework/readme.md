# Laboratory 2

## &#9745; Compulsory
Compulsory part of first laboratory is ready.
* - [x] Create an object-oriented model of the problem. You should have (at least) the following classes: Event, Room.
* - [x] The start and end time will be integers. The rooms will also have the property type. The available types will be implemented as an enum .
* - [x] Each class should have appropriate constructors, getters and setters.
* - [x] Use the IDE features for code generation, such as generating getters and setters.
* - [x] The toString method form the Object class must be properly overridden for all the classes.
* - [x] Use the IDE features for code generation, for example (in NetBeans) press Alt+Ins or invoke the context menu, select "Insert Code" and then "toString()" (or simply start typing "toString" and then press Ctrl+Space).
* - [x] Create and print on the screen the objects in the example.


## &#9745; Homework
* - [x] Create a class that describes an instance of the problem.
* - [x] Override the equals method form the Object class for the Event, Room classes. The problem should not allow adding the same event or room twice.
* - [x] Instead of using an enum, create dedicated classes for lecture halls and computer labs. Room will become abstract. The course room may have an additional property indicating if there is a video projector, and the lab room may indicate the operating system of its computers.
* - [x] Create a class to describe the solution.
* - [x] Implement a simple algorithm for creating a feasible solution to the problem, "trying" to minimize the number of used rooms.
* - [x] Write doc comments in your source code and generate the class documentation using javadoc.
